# 📝 Text Summarization with PEGASUS and T5

This project demonstrates abstractive text summarization using two powerful transformer-based models:

- `google/pegasus-xsum`
- `t5-base`

---

## 🔍 Models

### 🔹 PEGASUS
- Pretrained for extreme summarization (one-sentence summaries)
- Great for news, articles, and concise summaries

### 🔹 T5
- Flexible model for summarization, Q&A, translation, etc.
- Uses prefix prompting (e.g., `"summarize:"`)

## ⚙️ Requirements

pip install transformers torch
